      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Hazama is a unique offensive character with unconventional, yet powerful, mobility tools. With his stepdash and short normals, Hazama may seem weak at first. However, his Drive allows him to fire out a series of chain grappling hooks as an amazing approaching tool with several followups. Paired with his stance and other specials, Hazama has a variety of tools to approach and open up any character as he chooses. He needs to be careful with how he approaches, however, as his Drive is a limited resource and he lacks defensive tools outside of system mechanics. Played well, Hazama uses his toolset to engage from almost anywhere on the screen and open up his opponents.

      5B, even with its short range, is a very, very good normal.
      This normal's high frame advantage gives Hazama exceptionally strong stagger pressure and frametraps.
      Landing a counter-hit with this can link into a second 5B, making this a solid confirm tool.

      A great air-to-air that's untechable for a good amount of time.
      Proper spacing of this normal can make certain Drive approaches safe.

      A useful close range pressure maker that can force the opponent to play a guessing game with you.
      Also an essential combo tool.
    </p> 
    <p>
      Causes a crumple on ground hit and a ground bounce on air hit.
      After the hit lands, Hazama will enter the stance automatically.
      For the first 22 frames, Hazama can use normal versions of his Stance specials.
      After that, Hazama will use the Charged version of his stance moves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that this move is very susceptible to IBs as its main follow-ups are all punishable under IB,
      so don't be predictable when using this in blockstrings.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's also notable that, since the Stance is a part of the moves recovery,
      you can rapid-cancel during it, though this goes away if you dash during the stance.

        Frame advantage refers to when you can do a stance followup;
        assuming an immediate stance cancel, you're -3 on block.
