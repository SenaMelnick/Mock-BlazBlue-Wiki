      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Rachel is a high skill-floor/high skill-ceiling character. Her gameplan is a mix between strong zoning/screen control in neutral and strong mixup/setplay on offense. Her drive is a unique wind mechanic that can influence not only Rachel's movement and momentum, but her projectiles and even her opponent to a degree. Rachel's kit is quite well rounded with good buttons to poke, anti air, air to airs, and great projectiles that can cover almost any space when paired with wind and the infamous George XIII. Her main gameplan revolves around keeping and controlling space in neutral until she finds a hit that lets her get in, knock the opponent down and run her insane mix.

      Rachel's longest poke.
      Great for dealing with people who are reckless with approach,
      have slow moves or have comparable reach with their pokes.
      On CH, 6B only blows back and wall bounces on air Counter Hit.
      Converting counterhit 6B into a full combo at max range is tricky but in general,
      you convert grounded CH into a full combo by linking micro dash 6B > jc j.3DB > j.C > etc.
    </p>
    <p>
    6B is jump cancellable so it can also be used to extend combos/pressure
    if you are too far to hit the opponent with 5B. For example,
    6B > (9jc > j.2D or j.3D~j.A) or 5D~3C is a 50/50 mix-up.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Causes a stagger effect on ground Counter Hit</li>
      <li>Blows back and wallbounces on air Counter Hit</li>

      A high risk, high reward move.
      On one hand, its guardpoint allows Rachel to interrupt your opponent and possibly combo out of it.
      However, it also comes with several flaws: the guardpoint is not frame 1 and will lose to any meaty,
      the startup is quite slow, it has poor horizontal range,
      and is extremely unsafe both on whiff and on block.
      2C is also used in a small handful of combos due to its huge damage and excellent proration values 
      (94% P2 with 110% bonus on the first use).

      Rachel slowly floats to the ground.
      After a short delay, Rachel is able to cancel the float into attacks or airdash,
      or even block while floating. Inputting Barrier after the delay will cancel the float,
      but if the buttons are already held beforehand then Rachel will be able to Barrier in float.
    </p> 
    <p>
      Going into j.[C] can let Rachel do other moves slightly (2 frames) sooner than recovering from j.C,
      allowing Rachel to continue combos she otherwise would not be able to.
      It can also be used as a stalling mechanic to win via the clock,
      as it allows Rachel to freely wind herself in different directions and stay in the air
      for a very long time. Rachel falls more quickly for a period of time if she's winded too high,
      often making it more optimal to simply use wind to push Rachel upwards instead of using j.[C] with it.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Used in some air juggle routes to minimize wind usage</li>
      <li>Retains some aerial momentum</li>
      <li>
        While held, Rachel's falling speed is fixed and does not accelerate on its own.
        Rachel descends faster the the higher up she is.
      </li>
    </ul> <br> <br>
