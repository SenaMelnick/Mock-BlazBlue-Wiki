      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Kokonoe is a well-rounded character with a variety of tools. She has
        traps to set up strong setplay and mixups, alongside great normals to
        control space. These benefits are all backed up with strong damage and
        great corner carry. Kokonoe's Drive lets her use Gravitons to push and
        pull both herself and her opponent in order to catch opponents off guard
        or reposition herself. In the right hands, Kokonoe can dismantle any
        character with superior neutral tools and stellar setplay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kokonoe is not without her weaknesses, however. In neutral, characters
        that can ignore the midrange find great success. Mobile characters can
        run up close to blow her up for setting traps, and zoners can disengage
        from them entirely. On offense, some of her setups and combos require
        more spatial awareness and adjustments than average. Additionally,
        characters with good reversals can break some of her setups. As a
        result, her matchups tend to vary greatly. These traits altogether make
        for a character that is somewhat difficult to pick up. The reward,
        thankfully, is worth the trouble. Kokonoe has a strong toolset that
        leaves room for creativity and expression.

      Kokonoe's jab and her fastest normal. Despite not having much range, it
      can be a good combo starter as Kokonoe can still get the same oki from her
      B starters with 5A just for a little less damage.

      Kokonoe's only ground overhead. Can be gatling'd into by 5A or 2A into 6B.
      Uncharged 6B is a great overhead to open opponents up with, especially
      when combined with Kokonoe's oki tools. The charged version of 6B is
      mostly only good for some combos. Similar to Mu, you can Rapid Cancel the
      first hit of 6B into 2B, however unlike Mu, Kokonoe gets the benefit of
      having both hits of her 6B hitting high instead of just the second hit
      being a overhead.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Good overhead</li>
      <li>Second hit of 6B will force crouch on the opponent</li>
      <li>
        Fully charged 6B will cause a ground bounce on standing opponents.
        However, it also has a unique property where the first hit of 6[B] will
        cause a hard knockdown on aerial opponents

      Mostly used in specific grounded combo routes. In blockstrings, it can be
      used to safely put down Flame Cage or Banishing Rays thanks to it being +1
      on block and the pushback it does on block and barrier. Be wary, its slow
      startup can lead to opponents DPing you before you even get the chance to
      hit them with 2C.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fatal Counter can allow Kokonoe to loop 2C>5C on the opponent for corner
      carry.
